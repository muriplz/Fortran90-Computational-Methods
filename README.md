# COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

## What can you find here?
There are only Fortran modules. There are no working programs in here as I only upload the functions/subroutines needed in order to have working methods.
If you would like me to upload the actual test programs you can open a Github Issue.

## Contents:

#### Function Roots
```
Bisection Method (TBD)
False Position Method (TBD)
Newton-Raphson Method (TBD)
Secant Method (TBD)
```
#### Linear Systems
```
Gauss Elimination
Doolite (LU descomposition) (TBD)
Linear System solution
```
#### Interpolations
```
Direct Method
Lagrange Method
Newton Method (TBD)
Newton-Gregory Method (TBD)
```
## Cooming Soon:
```
Derivates
Integrals
```

**TBD** = To Be Done
