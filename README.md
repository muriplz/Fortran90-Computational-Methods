# COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

## What can you find here?
There are only Fortran modules. There are no working programs in here as I only upload the functions/subroutines needed in order to have working methods.
If you would like me to upload the actual test programs you can open a Github Issue.

## Contents:

### Function Roots
Quick explanation: find **x** so that **f(x)=0** (or **f(x+Δx)≈0** as an aproximated value)
```
Bisection Method (NT)
False Position Method (NT)
Newton-Raphson Method (NT)
Secant Method (TBD)
```
### Linear Systems
Quick explanation: find vector **x** so that A*x=b  (A being a matrix and b a vector of independent terms)
```
Gauss Elimination
Doolitle (LU descomposition) (TBD)
Linear System solution
```
### Interpolations
Quick explanation: Given a discrete set of data points, estimate f(x) so that you can have any (estimated) image
```
Direct Method
Lagrange Method
Newton Method
Newton-Gregory Method
```
## Coming Soon:
```
Derivates
Integrals
```

**TBD** = To Be Done
**NT** = Not Tested
